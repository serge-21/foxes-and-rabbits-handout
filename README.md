## Overview
The Predator/Prey simulator is a full customisable simulation that gives the user full creativity when creating a simualtion the default state of the simulation gives the user 5 entities (2 predators, 2 prey and 1 plant) that they can configure to their liking. The survivability of each entity is dependant on their configuration and the food chanin works where predators eat the prey and prey eat the plants. All entities require water to survive which they can get from rainy weather. There are also diseases which may affect the lifespan of an entity.
