---
This is a predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits and a couple other species in an enclosed rectangular field.

How to start:

   - Create a Simulator object.
   - Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
